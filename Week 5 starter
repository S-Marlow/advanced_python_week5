# you can have your application run in the terminal or you can use a library like Tkinter to make it work on the desktop  
#
# Your application must meet the following requirements:
#
# 1- correctly displays data for a given user input (daily)
# 2- displays t-3 data for a given user input (past 3 days)
# 3- displays t+5 data for a given user input (weekly forecast)
# 4- displays 3-year-average for a given input to a particular day (historical data average)

# students will be graded based on attempted code. if no solution is attemped for a given criteria, minimum score will be given (5 points)
# MVP is 55 points across all four criteria 
# students are encouraged to read openweathermap.org documentation before attempting to write their solution
